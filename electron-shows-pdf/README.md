# ElectronApp

This is a simple Electron app showing how to use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. To run it,
<ul>
<li>You need node.js and the Angular CLI</li>
<li>`cd` to the root directory of the project (i.e. the directory of this `README.md` file)</li>
<li>`npm install`</li>
<li>`npm start`</li>
</ul>

Kudos to https://buddy.works/tutorials/building-a-desktop-app-with-electron-and-angular for explaining how to set up an Angular application in Electron.

To benefit from Hot Module Reloading, run `npm run dev`. My HMR implementation is only a hacky solution, based on what I learned on https://flaviocopes.com/electron-hot-reload/ in five minutes. Improvements are welcome!
